Astro::	- Assorted astronomical routines

Astro::Time, Astro::Coord and Astro::Misc provide a collection of useful
astronomical routines written entirely in Perl (so no hassling about
installing external libraries is required).

The routines provided include various time conversions (dayno to day/month,
local sidereal time, calendar to Modified Julian day) and coordinate
transformations (J2000 to B1950, B1950 to Galactic, Az,El to Ha,Dec),
string parsing (12:00:00 -> 0.5) as well as a number of astronomical tools
(eg observed Galactic velocity to kinematic distance).

*NOTE* These routines should probably NOT be considered high
precision. I have tried as far as possible to compare the results with
other libraries (mainly SLALIB), but I guarantee nothing. The results
should probably be to better than an arcsec or so, and provide a great
mechanism for planning observations and searching through catalogs
but be wary. In particular the J2000 <-> B1950 conversion is different
to the SLALIB conversion of around 0.2 arcsec.

Please let me know of any bugs you find of if you have other routines you
would like to contribute.
